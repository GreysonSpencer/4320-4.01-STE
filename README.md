Considering Edward Snowden's release of Top Secret files to the public

The two technical systems that I observed to be affected by the whistleblowing were the NSA's domestic surveillance network and the military technical capabilities. This is because Snowden released documents outlining how the surveillance network worked and that it was actually spying on US citizens as well as persons of interest abroad. The second system affected was the military technical capabilities because he also released many classified documents about the military's technology.

The three sociotechnical systems I observed to be affected were people's perception of the US government, people's interaction with their telephone, and governments' impressions of whistleblowers. The reason their perception was affected was because they were previously unaware that the government was spying on them. People's use of their telephones also probably was affected by becoming more careful with what sensitive information they share. Governments' impressions of whistleblowers probably changed for the worse and they were probably enlightened to how much more dangerous they are when files can be transferred digitally.
